## As the project is in very early stages

As the project is in very early stages, the code is not exactly great (As I am mostly experimenting for now), and also it means a lot of things are not implemented yet.

As I am creating a "Lets Code" series for this, certain PRs and contributions will likely be rejected if they add very very major features, since I would like to do for them series and might not be in "original desing).

For example, things like adding the terrain generation, a day night cycle, LUA scripting integration etc (Haven't done these as of yet) will be rejected (for now).

However, things like refactoring code, improving systems, fixing spelling mistakes, improving efficiently, etc

## Anyways

Please create an issue first. I will check to see if this is planned for the series, or whether you can go ahead and do it.

Once approved, I will happlily accept a PR related to it.
